/**
 * Climb OUT of water onto a raised bank — the water counterpart to {@link PillarTask}.
 *
 * <h2>Why this exists</h2>
 *
 * FastNavigator meets a bank above the bot and, being unable to jump-step it, starts
 * {@link PillarTask} (place a block under yourself and rise). Pillaring needs solid footing to jump
 * and place from; in water the bot only bobs and places nothing — measured on a lake bench, 40s+
 * stuck at a +1 bank, and skipping to the physics engine did not swim it up either.
 *
 * <p>The right move from water is the one a player uses: at the surface, hold JUMP (which is "swim
 * up" in liquid) and hold FORWARD aimed at the ledge, and buoyancy plus forward carry you up and
 * onto it. That is all this task does, driven tick-by-tick from the client mixin exactly like
 * PillarTask, until the body is standing on the ledge and out of the water (or it stops making
 * progress and hands back).
