/**
 * Tungsten-native smart block-space move generation, modelled on baritone's
 * Movements (Traverse / Ascend / Descend / Parkour) but implemented on tungsten's
 * own world/shape API — baritone is NOT imported. For a feet position it emits
 * only the few VALID neighbour moves (each already walkable/landable) instead of
 * a blind r=8 scan, so the A* branching factor collapses and the search can route
 * stepped/gap terrain within its node budget.
 *
 * A "feet" position is the block the player's feet occupy; the player stands on
 * feet.below() with feet and feet.above() clear (head room).
 *
 * ⛔ CORRECTED 2026-09-05: this used to say "nothing calls it yet... wired in later,
 * separately-tested step" -- stale. {@code generate} IS called, live, from
 * {@code BlockNode.getChildren} (behind {@code TungstenConfig.smartMoves}, default
 * {@code false}). See that flag's javadoc in TungstenConfig.java for the measured A/B
 * history: smartMoves ON currently fails nav_water (final_dist=25.5, 9 freezes) even
 * with the water moves below present and firing (smWater counter measured non-zero) --
 * an open, tracked investigation, not a reason to distrust this file's own logic in
 * isolation. Read that flag's comment before changing anything here; it has the
 * current state of the actual measurements.
